# Movie Review Sentiment Analysis
This project is for the Practical Statistical Learning course at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. In this project, students are given a dataset of movie reviews with associated sentiments (positive or negative) and tasked with constructing a vocabulary list. With this list, students are given 5 splits of training and test data from the original dataset, and tasked to give a probability that a review is positive. The goal of this project is to maximize the AUC over the 5 test sets, while minimizing the size of the vocabulary list.
